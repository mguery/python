## Lesson 1: Setting a Foundation for Successful Test Automation 

### Designing a test automation strategy

Whats your goal? Key here is to understand what it is youâ€™re trying to accomplish.
- reduce time it takes to execute regression testing
- release features faster
- enable continuous testing as part of your build process

Who will participate in t.a. and in what capacity?
- who will write the t.a. scripts
- monitor results when tests run
- update tests when behavior othe app changes

How do you plan the execution of your defined strategy?
- which test to automate
- whats the scenario (actions and expected results defined)
- implementation (tooling, develop standards and conventions)
- how will tests be executed
